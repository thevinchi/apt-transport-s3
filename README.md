## apt-transport-s3
Allow to have a privately hosted apt repository on S3. Access keys are read from
`/etc/apt/s3auth.conf` file or IAM role if machine is hosted on AWS or has
access to IMDS on 169.254.169.254. They are also taken from the
usual environment variables.

## Requirements
### Additional package dependencies (except installed by default in Debian)
1. python3
2. python3-configobj

## Configuration
/etc/apt/s3auth.conf or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM role</a> can provide credentials required for using private apt repositories.

NOTE: Region MUST match the region the buckets are stored in and if not defined
it will try to fetch it from the metadata service.

Setting Endpoint allows for using providers other than Amazon AWS. If set, Endpoint disregards Region.

Example of s3auth.conf file:
```
AccessKeyId = myaccesskey
SecretAccessKey = mysecretaccesskey
Region = 'us-east-1'
Endpoint = 'nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com'
```

## Usage
Install the .deb package from the releases page. The bucket repo should be
specified using an s3:// prefix, for example:

`deb s3://aptbucketname/repo/ trusty main contrib non-free`

if you need to use a proxy to connect to the internet you can specify this
as an APT configuration directive (for example in
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90apt-transport-s3)

`Acquire::http::Proxy "http://myproxy:3128/";`

Bucket name hosting repo can not contain dots in it's name as this (according
to
[AWS S3 naming convention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html))
will invalidate virtual host style paths TLS certificates.

## Testing
The module will run in interactive mode. It accepts on `stdin` and outputs on
`stdout`. The messages it accepts on stdin
are in the following format and
[documented here](http://www.fifi.org/doc/libapt-pkg-doc/method.html/index.html#abstract).

```
600 URI Acquire
URI:s3://my-s3-repository/project-a/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages
Filename:Packages.downloaded
Fail-Ignore:true
Index-File:true

```

This message will trigger an s3 get from the above bucket and key and save it to
Filename. It needs a blank line after the message to trigger the processing by
the s3 method.
